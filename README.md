# Docker Learning
Have created a simple web application by installing flask and utilising Python.
Then had created the Docker file and image and placed it all within a container and ran on an image pointing to port 5002.
All relevant code will be in the hello_flask folder and the Linkinh MySQL container.

Docker Learning Docker Module
This repository documents my journey into the world of Docker, from building and running containers to managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose and pushing images to AWS ECR. My approach has been hands-on, building small projects to consolidate learning and applying real-world DevOps concepts.

What I learnt
Introduction to Docker: Understanding what containers are, how they differ from virtual machines, and why Docker is a critical tool in modern DevOps workflows.

Container Lifecycle: How to build images (docker build), run containers (docker run), inspect them (docker inspect), and manage their lifecycle (docker stop, docker rm).

Networking and Volumes: Connecting containers on the same network for inter-service communication and using volumes to persist data beyond container lifecycles.

Docker Hub & AWS ECR: Pushing and pulling Docker images to public (Docker Hub) and private registries (AWS ECR), including authentication and tagging workflows.

Docker Compose: Managing multi-container applications with a single docker-compose.yml file, defining services, ports, dependencies, and networks.

Optimizing Docker Images: Using multi-stage builds to reduce image size, remove unnecessary build dependencies and create efficient production-ready containers.

Debugging & Logs: Inspecting containers, reviewing logs and troubleshooting networking issues between containers.

System Cleanup: Keeping the Docker environment clean by removing unused images, stopping containers and dangling volumes using commands like docker system prune.

Container Orchestration Overview: Learning why tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are used for scaling and managing containers across multiple machines and understanding their differences.

Docker Challenge: Flask + Redis Multi-Container App
As a practical exercise, I built a multi-container application consisting of:

A Python Flask web application that serves a welcome page and tracks visit counts.
A Redis database to store visit counts using persistent storage.
Key concepts applied in this challenge:

Using a Dockerfile to containerize the Flask application.
Using the official Redis Docker image and connecting it to Flask.
Managing both services with Docker Compose, ensuring proper networking and dependencies.
Implementing persistent storage with Docker volumes, so Redis data survives container restarts.
Experimenting with environment variables and scaling services (bonus challenge).
By completing this challenge, I was able to understand how Docker allows consistent application deployment across environments and how containerisation simplifies development, testing and production workflows.
